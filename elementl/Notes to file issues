1. mypy compliance
tutorial: https://docs.dagster.io/tutorial/types#mypy-compliance 
overview: https://docs.dagster.io/overview/types#mypy-compliance

In the first option of the tutorial, it won't catch type errors if the types of your input definition and output definition are more than regular python types

The second option which is the same as that in overview is for richer type check = custom dagster type.
typing.TYPE_CHECKING is from python, not dagster
